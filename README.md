# metrobi-challenge

## This repository contains all the code for the metrobi challenge

## Instructions:
1. Open the repository on your editor or terminal;
2. Install all the dependencies using your preferred package manager. I like using `pnpm` because it's waay faster;
3. Run the `dev` script to start the react code on `localhost:3000`.

Note: The code for the question can be found under the "questions" folder.
